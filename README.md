1. git clone https://github.com/tony9321/refactored-succotash.git 
2. npm install
3. try to ask a question like generate the Python code for blender for a sphere with a radius of 2 inches or a cube or some simple object first, it might not always work(you can keep regenerating or change the prompt a little bit), but use the bottom preview part to verify if you can see it
4. play with the prompt and think about how we can refine it to make more complex objects
